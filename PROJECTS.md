## Haskell Projects

### Description

`haskell-projects` is a web application that connects mentors and learners to work on real Haskell projects.
Do you want a thing to exist in the Haskell ecosystem?
Make it a project idea!
Do you want to help people learn Haskell?
Pick projects to mentor!
Do you want to learn how to build things in Haskell with guided mentorship?
Find a project and start working on it!

### Mentorship Offered

I (Matt Parsons) am currently sketching out the initial design and implementation.
Once it is minimally done, I will shift gears and start writing issues for feature requests.
If you would like to help, pick an issue and implement it!

I will be happy to talk through problems thoroughly and provide advice on implementations.
I'm also happy to pair program via Hangouts if that's helpful.
If you're in Denver, we can cowork on it is as well.

### Contact Information

Make an issue on the repo, or send me an email (parsonsmatt@gmail.com)

## Haskell Tips and Tricks

### Description

A website where people can submit small tips and tricks, vote on their usefulness, and provide comments.

### Mentorship Offered

I'm (Matt Parsons) happy to help design and implement the application.
I suspect that an MVP would be a very simple website with database connection.
